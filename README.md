# AtMega128A_LCD_CALCULATOR
A simple Int Calculator that is attached to a LCD using a provided library that was provided by me
The Calculator itself operates as a state machine, and interupts called when buttons on an external keypad are pressed alter the current state.
Overall all it is not that complex of code, and there are several improvements that could be made, such as using an array to initially setting a correct coresponding
value instead of the current method where a very long switch case list determines the correct output. 
Furthermore, the calculator itself can be very finicky. 
I just figured I would post something on here for the first time.
